title: Blogging With GitHub Pages

I've always wanted a place to talk about the projects I'm working on but a traditional blog just didn't feel right. A few weeks ago I stumbled across [GitHub Pages][] and my inner geek was instantly aroused. GitHub Pages is really just free static site hosting coupled with a tool called [Jekyll][] to generate your site's contents based on layouts and Markdown or Textile formatted text. This is both simple and powerful. It removes the distractions and lets you focus on what really matters - the content.

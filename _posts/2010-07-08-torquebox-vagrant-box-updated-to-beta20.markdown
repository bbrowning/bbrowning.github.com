title: TorqueBox Vagrant Box Updated to Beta20

layout: post

Hot on the heels of the [TorqueBox Beta20 release][beta20_release], I've pushed an updated version of the TorqueBox Vagrant box. The box is now 1.6GB in size - I'm not entirely sure why it's larger than last time but if I figure it out I'll upload a smaller version.

[beta20_release]: http://torquebox.org/news/2010/07/07/torquebox-1-0-0-beta20-finally/

Grab it here:

<http://bbrowning-boxes.s3.amazonaws.com/torquebox.box-1.0.0.Beta20.box> (direct download)

Refer to my [previous post][] for details on getting started with TorqueBox and Vagrant.
